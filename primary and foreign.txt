-- Step 1: Create a new database (if not already created)
CREATE DATABASE CompanyDB;

-- Step 2: Use the database
USE CompanyDB;

-- Step 3: Create the Departments table with a primary key
CREATE TABLE Departments (
    department_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    department_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);

-- Step 4: Create the Employees table with a primary key and a foreign key
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    employee_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    department_id INT,  -- This will be our foreign key
    FOREIGN KEY (department_id) REFERENCES Departments(department_id)
);

-- Step 5: Insert data into Departments
INSERT INTO Departments (department_name) VALUES ('HR'), ('Engineering'), ('Sales');

-- Step 6: Insert data into Employees with foreign key references
INSERT INTO Employees (employee_name, department_id) VALUES 
('Alice', 1),  -- HR department
('Bob', 2),  -- Engineering department
('Charlie', 3);  -- Sales department


-- Step 5: Insert data into Departments
INSERT INTO Departments (department_name) VALUES ('HR'), ('Engineering'), ('Sales');

-- Step 6: Insert data into Employees with foreign key references
INSERT INTO Employees (employee_name, department_id) VALUES 
('Alice', 1),  -- HR department
('Bob', 2),  -- Engineering department
('Charlie', 3);  -- Sales department
