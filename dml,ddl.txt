-- Create the database and tables
CREATE DATABASE CompanyDB;

USE CompanyDB;

CREATE TABLE Departments (
    department_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    department_name VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE Employees (
    employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    employee_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    department_id INT,
    hire_date DATE,
    FOREIGN KEY (department_id) REFERENCES Departments(department_id)
);

-- Insert sample data
INSERT INTO Departments (department_name) 
VALUES ('HR'), ('Engineering'), ('Sales');

INSERT INTO Employees (employee_name, department_id, hire_date) 
VALUES 
    ('Alice', 1, '2023-01-01'), 
    ('Bob', 2, '2023-02-01'), 
    ('Charlie', 3, '2023-03-01'),
    ('Dave', 2, '2023-04-01');

-- Step 1: Create a simple view showing employee names and their department names
CREATE VIEW EmployeeDepartmentView AS
SELECT e.employee_name, d.department_name
FROM Employees e
JOIN Departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id;

-- Step 2: Query the view
SELECT * FROM EmployeeDepartmentView;

-- Step 3: Update the base table through the view (this should work since the view is based on a single table with no complex operations)
UPDATE Employees
SET employee_name = 'Alice Smith'
WHERE employee_id = (SELECT employee_id FROM EmployeeDepartmentView WHERE employee_name = 'Alice');

-- Verify the update through the view
SELECT * FROM EmployeeDepartmentView;

-- Step 4: Create a view with restrictions on updates (using a group function)
CREATE VIEW DepartmentEmployeeCountView AS
SELECT d.department_name, COUNT(e.employee_id) AS employee_count
FROM Employees e
JOIN Departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id
GROUP BY d.department_name;

-- This view cannot be updated because it contains a group function
SELECT * FROM DepartmentEmployeeCountView;

-- Step 5: Create a view joining multiple tables with an additional field
CREATE VIEW ExtendedEmployeeView AS
SELECT e.employee_name, e.hire_date, d.department_name
FROM Employees e
JOIN Departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id;

-- Query the view to check the result
SELECT * FROM ExtendedEmployeeView;
